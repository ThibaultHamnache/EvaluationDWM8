        In the page Series you will be able to customize your
        library of series by add new ones with many information
        like how many episodes or seasons the serie had or have if
        its still in production, you will be able to delete one or
        update one if you have complementary inforamtion.
        In the page Movies you can almost do the same like create,
        update, delete, but without seasons or episode cause you know its a movie.
        PS: PLS DO NOT INSERT BAD MOVIES LIKE BLADE :)</span>
